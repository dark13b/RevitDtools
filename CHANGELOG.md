  - Implemented proper transaction separation for symbol activation and column creation
  - Eliminated nested transaction conflicts
  - Added graceful error handling for activation failures

- **Batch Processing Failures**: Fixed issue where only partial columns were created (e.g., 6 out of 66)
  - Enhanced fallback system for family symbol matching
  - Added similarity-based symbol selection when exact matches aren't found
  - Improved error reporting with specific failure reasons

- **Logger Compilation Errors**: Fixed all Logger static method call issues
  - Updated Logger calls to use proper static method signatures
  - Added required context parameters to all logging calls
  - Resolved TaskDialog namespace conflicts

#### Added
