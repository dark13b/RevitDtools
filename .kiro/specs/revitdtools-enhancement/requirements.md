# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RevitDtools is a C# add-in for Autodesk Revit 2026 that converts DWG imports to native Revit elements and creates structural columns from detail lines. The project has a solid foundation (70% complete) but requires critical fixes and significant enhancements to achieve production readiness (95% complete). This enhancement focuses on resolving build issues, expanding geometry support, implementing batch processing, and adding professional-grade features for enterprise workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Build System and Compilation Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RevitDtools project to build successfully without errors, so that I can test and deploy the add-in to Revit 2026.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the solution is built in Visual Studio THEN the project SHALL compile without errors or warnings
2. WHEN the build process completes THEN the bin directory SHALL contain all necessary assemblies and dependencies
3. WHEN the post-build deployment script runs THEN the add-in SHALL be automatically deployed to the Revit add-ins directory
4. WHEN Revit 2026 starts THEN the RevitDtools add-in SHALL load successfully without errors
5. IF there are API version conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically or provide clear error messages
6. WHEN both Debug and Release configurations are built THEN both SHALL compile successfully

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Geometry Processing

**User Story:** As a Revit user, I want to convert all types of DWG geometry elements to Revit detail lines, so that I can work with complete imported drawings without manual conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DWG file contains arc elements THEN the system SHALL convert them to Revit arc detail lines
2. WHEN a DWG file contains spline elements THEN the system SHALL convert them to Revit spline detail lines
3. WHEN a DWG file contains ellipse elements THEN the system SHALL convert them to Revit ellipse detail lines
4. WHEN a DWG file contains text elements THEN the system SHALL convert them to Revit text notes
5. WHEN a DWG file contains hatch patterns THEN the system SHALL convert them to Revit filled regions
6. WHEN a DWG file contains nested blocks THEN the system SHALL process them recursively and convert all contained geometry
7. IF geometry conversion fails for any element THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other elements

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Column Family Management

**User Story:** As a structural engineer, I want the system to automatically create and manage column families, so that I don't need to manually set up families before creating columns from detail lines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a column from detail lines THEN the system SHALL automatically create the required family if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN a custom column size is needed THEN the system SHALL create a new family symbol with the specified dimensions
3. WHEN the add-in starts THEN the system SHALL load standard column families automatically
4. WHEN validating a family for column creation THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with structural column requirements
5. IF a family creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and fallback options
6. WHEN multiple columns with the same dimensions are created THEN the system SHALL reuse existing family symbols

### Requirement 4: Batch Processing Capabilities

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to process multiple DWG files simultaneously, so that I can efficiently handle large-scale projects with dozens of drawings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple DWG files are selected THEN the system SHALL process them sequentially with progress tracking
2. WHEN a folder containing DWG files is selected THEN the system SHALL process all DWG files in the folder and subfolders
3. WHEN batch processing is running THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress with file names and completion status
4. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive summary report
5. IF any file fails during batch processing THEN the system SHALL continue with remaining files and report failures
6. WHEN batch processing is cancelled THEN the system SHALL stop gracefully and preserve completed work

### Requirement 5: User Settings and Persistence

**User Story:** As a frequent user, I want my preferences and settings to be saved automatically, so that I don't need to reconfigure the tool every time I use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user preferences are modified THEN the system SHALL save them automatically to persistent storage
2. WHEN the add-in starts THEN the system SHALL load previously saved user preferences
3. WHEN layer mapping templates are created THEN the system SHALL save them for reuse in future projects
4. WHEN default column families are configured THEN the system SHALL remember them for subsequent sessions
5. IF settings file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL restore default settings and notify the user
6. WHEN settings are exported THEN the system SHALL create a portable configuration file

### Requirement 6: Professional Error Logging and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error logging and diagnostic information, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context and stack traces
2. WHEN a processing session completes THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed processing report
3. WHEN requested by the user THEN the system SHALL export error logs to a specified file location
4. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL track usage statistics for performance monitoring
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL notify users immediately with actionable information
6. WHEN diagnostic mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7: Advanced Column Creation Features

**User Story:** As a structural engineer, I want to create various types of structural columns beyond basic rectangular shapes, so that I can model complex structural systems accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating circular columns THEN the system SHALL generate columns with specified center point and diameter
2. WHEN custom column shapes are needed THEN the system SHALL create columns from user-defined profile curves
3. WHEN column schedule data is available THEN the system SHALL apply it automatically to created columns
4. WHEN creating multiple columns in a pattern THEN the system SHALL generate column grids based on specified parameters
5. IF column creation fails due to geometric constraints THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and alternative options
6. WHEN columns are created THEN the system SHALL automatically assign appropriate structural properties

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive automated testing, so that I can ensure the add-in works reliably across different scenarios and Revit versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN geometry processing functions are tested THEN unit tests SHALL verify correct conversion of all supported geometry types
2. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN the system SHALL test with various real-world DWG files
3. WHEN UI components are tested THEN automated tests SHALL verify WPF dialog functionality
4. WHEN Revit API interactions are tested THEN integration tests SHALL verify proper API usage
5. IF error conditions are simulated THEN tests SHALL verify proper error handling and recovery
6. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL meet specified processing time benchmarks
