# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RevitDtools is a .NET 8 Revit plugin that has been successfully migrated from .NET Framework, with the main project architecture now building successfully. However, 81 namespace conflicts remain that prevent clean compilation. These conflicts arise from ambiguous references between Revit API classes, WPF controls, WinForms controls, and system dialogs. This specification focuses on systematically resolving these conflicts through consistent namespace aliasing without breaking existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TaskDialog Namespace Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve TaskDialog ambiguity between Revit and WPF classes, so that the code compiles without namespace conflicts while maintaining existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TaskDialog is referenced in any file THEN the system SHALL use the RevitTaskDialog alias for Autodesk.Revit.UI.TaskDialog
2. WHEN scanning for TaskDialog conflicts THEN the system SHALL identify all files containing ambiguous TaskDialog references
3. WHEN applying the alias THEN the system SHALL add "using RevitTaskDialog = Autodesk.Revit.UI.TaskDialog;" to affected files
4. WHEN updating TaskDialog instantiations THEN the system SHALL replace "TaskDialog" with "RevitTaskDialog" in all affected code
5. IF a file uses both Revit and WPF TaskDialog THEN the system SHALL apply both aliases with clear naming conventions
6. WHEN build is executed after changes THEN TaskDialog-related errors SHALL be eliminated (~30 errors resolved)

### Requirement 2: MessageBox Namespace Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve MessageBox ambiguity between System.Windows.MessageBox and WinForms MessageBox, so that message display functionality works correctly without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MessageBox is referenced in any file THEN the system SHALL use the WpfMessageBox alias for System.Windows.MessageBox
2. WHEN scanning for MessageBox conflicts THEN the system SHALL identify all files with ambiguous MessageBox references
3. WHEN applying the alias THEN the system SHALL add "using WpfMessageBox = System.Windows.MessageBox;" to affected files
4. WHEN updating MessageBox calls THEN the system SHALL replace "MessageBox.Show" with "WpfMessageBox.Show" in all affected code
5. IF WinForms MessageBox is needed THEN the system SHALL apply WinFormsMessageBox alias as well
6. WHEN build is executed after changes THEN MessageBox-related errors SHALL be eliminated (~20 errors resolved)

### Requirement 3: UI Control Namespace Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve UI control ambiguities between WPF and WinForms controls, so that the WPF dialogs function correctly without namespace conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TextBox is referenced ambiguously THEN the system SHALL use WpfTextBox alias for System.Windows.Controls.TextBox
2. WHEN ComboBox is referenced ambiguously THEN the system SHALL use WpfComboBox alias for System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox
3. WHEN CheckBox is referenced ambiguously THEN the system SHALL use WpfCheckBox alias for System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox
4. WHEN Button is referenced ambiguously THEN the system SHALL use WpfButton alias for System.Windows.Controls.Button
5. WHEN applying control aliases THEN the system SHALL update both XAML and code-behind references consistently
6. WHEN build is executed after changes THEN UI control-related errors SHALL be eliminated (~15 errors resolved)

### Requirement 4: File Dialog Namespace Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve file dialog ambiguities between WPF and WinForms dialogs, so that file operations work correctly without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenFileDialog is referenced ambiguously THEN the system SHALL use WinFormsOpenFileDialog alias for System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog
2. WHEN SaveFileDialog is referenced ambiguously THEN the system SHALL use WinFormsSaveFileDialog alias for System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog
3. WHEN FolderBrowserDialog is referenced THEN the system SHALL use WinFormsFolderBrowserDialog alias for System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog
4. WHEN applying dialog aliases THEN the system SHALL update all dialog instantiations and property references
5. IF WPF dialogs are preferred THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration path to Microsoft.Win32 dialogs
6. WHEN build is executed after changes THEN file dialog-related errors SHALL be eliminated (~10 errors resolved)

### Requirement 5: View Namespace Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve View class ambiguity between Revit DB and other View classes, so that Revit view operations work correctly without namespace conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN View is referenced in Revit context THEN the system SHALL use RevitView alias for Autodesk.Revit.DB.View
2. WHEN scanning for View conflicts THEN the system SHALL identify remaining files with ambiguous View references
3. WHEN applying the alias THEN the system SHALL add "using RevitView = Autodesk.Revit.DB.View;" to affected files
4. WHEN updating View references THEN the system SHALL replace ambiguous "View" with "RevitView" in all affected code
5. IF other View types are used THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate aliases to maintain clarity
6. WHEN build is executed after changes THEN View-related errors SHALL be eliminated (~5 errors resolved)

### Requirement 6: Build Validation and Error Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all namespace conflicts are resolved and the project builds successfully, so that I can proceed with feature development without compilation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN namespace aliases are applied THEN the system SHALL build the project to verify error resolution
2. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL identify remaining conflicts and their locations
3. WHEN all conflicts are resolved THEN the build SHALL complete with zero errors
4. WHEN testing functionality THEN existing features SHALL work exactly as before the alias changes
5. IF new conflicts are introduced THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve them immediately
6. WHEN final validation is complete THEN the project SHALL be ready for feature enhancement development

### Requirement 7: Consistent Alias Strategy and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent namespace aliasing patterns across the codebase, so that the code is maintainable and follows .NET conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying aliases THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming patterns (e.g., WpfControlName, RevitClassName)
2. WHEN multiple aliases are needed in one file THEN the system SHALL organize them logically at the top of the file
3. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL maintain a record of all applied aliases and their purposes
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN aliases SHALL be clearly distinguishable and self-documenting
5. IF conflicts arise between alias patterns THEN the system SHALL prioritize clarity and consistency
6. WHEN future development occurs THEN the alias patterns SHALL serve as a template for consistent usage

### Requirement 8: Automated Conflict Detection and Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tools to detect and resolve namespace conflicts, so that the resolution process is systematic and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL automatically identify all namespace conflict locations
2. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (TaskDialog, MessageBox, Controls, etc.)
3. WHEN applying fixes THEN the system SHALL process conflicts systematically by category
4. WHEN validating fixes THEN the system SHALL verify that each category of errors is eliminated
5. IF manual intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL clearly identify what requires attention
6. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive summary of all changes made
