| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lines**         | ✅ Complete | Direct conversion to Revit detail lines            |
| **Arcs**          | ✅ Complete | Transform and create arc detail curves             |
| **Splines**       | ✅ Complete | NURBS spline conversion to detail curves           |
| **Ellipses**      | ✅ Complete | Ellipse geometry conversion to detail curves       |
| **PolyLines**     | ✅ Complete | Conversion to individual line segments             |
| **Text**          | ✅ Complete | Bounding box extraction and TextNote creation      |
| **Hatches**       | ✅ Complete | Boundary extraction and FilledRegion creation      |
| **Nested Blocks** | ✅ Complete | Recursive processing with transform multiplication |

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Layered Error Handling**: Each processor implements comprehensive error handling
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed elements are logged but don't stop processing
3. **Detailed Logging**: All operations are logged with context and timing
4. **User Feedback**: Processing results include detailed statistics and warnings

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Geometry Statistics**: Track and report processing statistics by geometry type
2. **Layer Filtering**: Only process geometry from selected layers
3. **Transform Caching**: Efficient transform operations for nested geometry
4. **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of geometry objects
